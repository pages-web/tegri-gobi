                  obligations of existing Travel Adventures are not affected by
                  such a termination. B) Terms for Travel Adventures - The Role
                  of TourRadar The combination of travel services offered to you
                  are packages within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2015/2302.
                  Therefore, you will benefit from all EU rights applying to
                  packages. The Operator will be fully responsible for the
                  proper performance of the package as a whole. Additionally, as
                  required by law, the Operator has to have protection in place
                  to refund your payments and, where transport is included in
                  the package, to ensure your repatriation in the event that it
                  becomes insolvent. More information on key rights under
                  Directive (EU) 2015/2302 here. The Travel Adventures are
                  independently created, offered and carried out by the
                  Operators at their own discretion and responsibility.
                  TourRadar is solely acting as a commercial agent for the
                  Operators. TourRadar is not an Operator, nor a provider of
                  Travel Adventures, nor a representative or proxy of an
                  Operator nor an insurer. TourRadar does not own, sell, resell,
                  furnish, provide, manage or control any transportation, tour
                  or travel services and does not act as an agent to the
                  Travelers. TourRadar has no control over the behavior of
                  Operators, Travelers and other users of the platform. It is
                  the responsibility of the traveler to be in possession of a
                  valid travel identification along with any necessary visa at
                  the time of the travel. The Traveler is also responsible for
                  compliance with applicable health requirements and recommended
                  or obligatory vaccinations. Conclusion of a Contract,
                  Documents & Information Travel Adventures are booked directly
                  with the respective Operator. The current Operators terms and
                  conditions apply. By clicking on “Book now” you are submitting
                  a binding offer for the selected Travel Adventure to the
                  respective Operator. The Travel Adventure contract is
                  concluded by the Operator accepting your offer (“Booking”). In
                  this case the contract is concluded directly between the
                  Traveler and the Operator. The contract text and your booking
                  data are saved by TourRadar to process the contractual
                  relationship. The Operators will confirm or reject a booking
                  request within 24 to 72 hours during which time your offer is
                  binding. As soon as the booking transaction is completed
                  (including successful (down) payment), the Traveler receives a
                  booking confirmation via email with a summary of the contract.
                  Booking on request: In certain circumstances you are informed
                  that a booking is “on request” (which is usually the case with
                  Travel Adventures booked shortly before the start of the
                  trip). In this case the Operator needs up to 5 Business days
                  to ensure that all components of the Travel Adventure can be
                  confirmed. In case of such a Booking on request the Traveler
                  is bound to his offer until the Operator either accepts or
                  rejects the booking. The Operators’ cancellation and payment
                  terms apply from the moment of your request. If the request is
                  accepted, you will be billed for the full amount. If the
                  Operator cannot confirm your request, you will receive a full
                  refund of any amounts already paid. Special requests by the
                  Traveler are non-binding, as long as they have not been
                  confirmed by the Operator. TourRadar will forward special
                  requests and inquiries of the Traveler to the Operator. A
                  binding performance commitment however is only available upon
                  confirmation by the respective Operator. Your Responsibilities
                  When using the TourRadar Services, you undertake to provide
                  all required personal information in a timely, complete and
                  truthful manner. In particular, you will provide upfront
                  information on all circumstances and restrictions affecting
                  the performance of the services by TourRadar and the Operator
                  (e.g. special needs such as food intolerance, restricted
                  mobility or state of health). Travelers who make a booking for
                  themselves or on behalf of third parties (such as fellow
                  travelers) through the Platform are deemed to be the client
                  and, in the absence of any other declaration, accept the
                  obligations arising out of their use of the Platform under
                  these terms and conditions. By using the TourRadar Services
                  for himself or others, the Traveler agrees to inform those
                  others of these terms and conditions. The Traveler accepts
                  that he is responsible for all bookings and travel
                  reservations made by anyone under his control. The Traveler
                  guarantees that all information that he provides directly or
                  indirectly through third parties is true, complete and
                  accurate and that the Traveler is not an unaccompanied minor.
                  Any exploratory, manipulative, speculative, false or
                  fraudulent booking (inquiry) is prohibited without
                  restriction. The Traveler undertakes to check all contractual
                  documents transmitted by means of the TourRadar Services (e.g.
                  travel contract, booking confirmation, vouchers) for factual
                  correctness and completeness (spelling mistakes, e.g. name,
                  date of birth, special travel requirements) and to report any
                  recognizable errors or defects in the activity of TourRadar
                  immediately. Travelers with restricted mobility, pregnant
                  Travelers and Travelers who require special medical care must
                  inform TourRadar of their special needs at least 48 hours
                  before the start of the journey. Travelers must immediately
                  report any perceived breach of contract, so that the
                  respective Operator can be put in a position to quickly remedy
                  any non-conformity which can be addressed with reasonable
                  effort. The Traveler is advised to file any complaints in
                  writing using the TourRadar Services and in particular the
                  Booking Management Page. If the Traveler fails to report a
                  lack of conformity, it can be prejudicial to the Traveler. The
                  mere report of a lack of conformity alone does not trigger any
                  legal obligations on the side of TourRadar or the Operator.
                  The Traveler is obliged to pay the contractually agreed fees
                  in due time and will indemnify and hold TourRadar harmless for
                  any damage caused by delay. The Traveler must inform TourRadar
                  without delay in the event that he receives payments arising
                  from claims for damages or price reduction due to breach of
                  contract. Payments and Fees If applicable and available,
                  certain Operators offer the opportunity for Bookings to be
                  paid (wholly or partly and as required under the payment
                  policy of the Operator) to the Operator during the Booking
                  process by means of secure online payment (all to the extent
                  offered and supported by your bank). For certain products and
                  services, TourRadar facilitates (through third party payment
                  processors) the payment of the relevant product or service
                  (i.e. the payment facilitation service) for and on behalf of
                  the Operator (TourRadar never acts nor operates as the
                  merchant of record). Payment is safely processed from your
                  credit/debit card or bank account to the bank account of the
                  Operator through a third party payment processor. Any payment
                  facilitated by us for and on behalf of, and transferred to the
                  Operator will in each case constitute a payment of (part of)
                  the booking price by you of the relevant product or service in
                  final settlement of such (partial) due and payable price and
                  you cannot reclaim such paid monies. TourRadar reserves the
                  right to offer to the Traveler particularly advantageous
                  payment options (e.g. installment payment models) itself or
                  through a payment service provider. If you accept, you agree
                  to be bound by the terms and conditions specified and
                  communicated by TourRadar or the payment service provider.
                  TourRadar may charge fees (and applicable Taxes) for the right
                  to use the Platform. Any applicable fees are disclosed to you
                  before making a Booking. Except as otherwise provided on the
                  Platform, service fees form part of final price and follow the
                  rules of each Booking in respect to cancellations and refunds.
                  TourRadar reserves the right to change the service fees at any
                  time. Fee changes will not affect prior made Bookings Trip
                  cancellations and refunds If the Operator does not confirm the
                  requested Booking or if an Operator cancels an existing
                  Booking, all authorizations made on the Traveler's (credit)
                  card will be automatically released and/or all amounts
                  collected through another payment method will be refunded to
                  the Traveler within 14 days. As soon as the Operator confirms
                  a Booking, the Operator’s cancellation and payment conditions
                  apply. Please read the important information on the Booking
                  Detail Page, Booking Management Page and in your booking
                  confirmation regarding the Operator's terms and conditions
                  carefully. Any cancellation must be made through the TourRadar
                  Services (booking management page). Complaints and claims from
                  the Traveler in relationship to Travel Adventures will be
                  handled by the Operators via the TourRadar Services. Important
                  information on insurance for package travel When booking
                  Travel Adventures well in advance, unforeseeable things can
                  happen. TourRadar recommends that all Travelers conclude the
                  following insurance policies which are not part of any Travel
                  Adventure: Travel cancellation insurance in order to minimize
                  financial risk in case of cancellation by the Traveler before
                  departure. Travel interruption insurance in order to minimize
                  financial risk in case of a travel interruption by the
                  Traveler after departure Adequate health insurance C)

                  Traveller has more Travel Credits than the capped allowance
                  the remainder of the Travel Credits will remain in the
                  Travellers account and can be used for additional bookings.
